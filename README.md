Helping to learn Computer Science before we head to College

# General Concepts

## Programming Logic & Problem Solving
- Breaking problems into smaller steps
- Using pseudocode or flowcharts
- Debugging and tracing code execution

## Memory and Data Management (Intro Level)
- Basic understanding of how memory works
- Concept of variables being stored in memory
- Introduction to pointers (even just knowing they exist helps)

## Code Organization and Style
- Writing readable code (indentation, naming conventions)
- Commenting code for clarity
- Understanding the structure of a C program (`main()` function, headers)

## Tools and Environment
- Familiarity with a text editor or IDE (like VS Code or Code::Blocks)
- Knowing how to compile and run a C program using a compiler (like GCC)

    ### Windows specifics
    - WSL for Linux environment
    - VSCode for editor
    - Github account for code / notes

# Specific to C

## Variables and Data Types
   - Understanding how data is stored (integers, floats, characters, etc.)
   - Knowing how to declare and use variables.

## Operators
   - Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
   - Comparison (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, etc.)
   - Logical (`&&`, `||`, `!`)

## Control Structures
   - `if`, `else`, `switch` statements
   - Loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`

## Functions
   - What functions are and why theyâ€™re useful
   - How to define and call functions
   - Understanding parameters and return values

## Basic Input/Output
   - Using `printf()` and `scanf()` for console I/O
   - Formatting output
